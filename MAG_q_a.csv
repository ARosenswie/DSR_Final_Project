What are some possible complications of acute pancreatitis?,"Possible complications of acute pancreatitis include pancreatic phlegmon, pancreatic pseudocyst, pancreatic ascites, hemorrhage through the pancreatic duct, renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","Possible complications of acute pancreatitis include infection, fluid collections in the abdomen, pseudocysts, abscesses, pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic pseudocysts, pancreatic ascites, pancreatic fistula, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These complications can be serious and can lead to further medical complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, and even death. It is important to seek medical attention if any of these symptoms are present.",,
What are some risk factors for developing esophageal cancer?,"Some risk factors for developing esophageal cancer include diet, alcohol excess, smoking, achalasia, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, obesity, diet low in vitamin A&C, nitrosamine exposure, reflux oesophagitis ± Barrett’s oesophagus.","Risk factors for developing esophageal cancer include smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, achalasia, certain genetic conditions, a diet low in fruits and vegetables, exposure to certain chemicals, and radiation therapy to the chest or upper abdomen. Additionally, certain lifestyle factors such as lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, and stress may increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer.",,
How does omeprazole suppress Helicobacter pylori?,"In vitro, omeprazole inhibits the growth of H. pylori below pH 7. Clinically, it is thought that omeprazole enhances the local immune response by increasing intragastric pH. It also reduces the washout of antibiotics from the mucosa and lowers the inhibitory concentrations of pHsensitive antibiotics","Omeprazole suppresses H. pylori by inhibiting the enzyme H+/K+-ATPase, which is responsible for acid production in the stomach. This reduces the acidity of the stomach, making it less hospitable for H. pylori to survive. In addition, the inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase may also prevent the interaction between coactivators p300 and PCAF and the foamy viral trans-activator, which could further reduce the survival of H. pylori.",,
How do you define autoimmune disease?,"In autoimmune disorders, the body generates immune responses against its own tissues, producing autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies. In normal development, T and B lymphocytes that recognize ‘self’ antigens are deleted in the thymus and bone marrow (central tolerance). Those that escape are suppressed by regulatory T cells in the circulation.","An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. It occurs when the body's own immune system, which normally protects us from infection and disease, instead attacks healthy cells and tissues, leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and a wide range of symptoms depending on the affected organ or system.",,
How safe is it to use antibiotics in the different trimesters of pregnancy?,"Antibiotics, like all drugs, should be avoided in pregnancy if possible. Co-trimoxazole is thought to be a teratogenic risk in the first trimester and produces neonatal haemolysis in the third trimester. Quinolones should also not be used in pregnancy. Whenever one is prescribing an antibiotic it is always wise to check local antibiotic policy, and this is even more so in pregnancy. Some drugs are not known to be harmful in pregnancy, e.g. penicillin.","Antibiotic use during pregnancy is generally considered safe, but the safety of specific antibiotics during each trimester of pregnancy should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that antibiotics be used judiciously during pregnancy, and that the potential risks and benefits of antibiotic use be weighed carefully. The ACOG also recommends that antibiotics be used only when necessary and that the lowest effective dose be used for the shortest duration possible, except in a small percentage of patients with abnormal clinical and non-invasive findings.",,
What are the uses and the side-effects of the antibiotic lincomycin?,Its uses and side-effects are similar to those of clindamycin. Its main use is in osteomyelitis because it is concentrated in bone.,"The uses of antibiotic lincomycin include treating bacterial infections that are not affected by other antibiotics, such as those caused by staphylococcus, streptococcus, and mycoplasma. The side-effects of antibiotic lincomycin include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and headache. It can also cause allergic reactions, such as rash, itching, and difficulty breathing.",,
Is there any drug taken orally that prevents penicillin hypersensitivity reactions?,"In the rare situation that no other antibiotic is available, steroid therapy would be the best measure to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Penicillins, cephalosporins or any other betalactam antibiotic should not be used in patients with a history of penicillin allergy","No, there is no drug taken orally that prevents penicillin hypersensitivity reactions. However, medications such as unfractioned heparin can be administered to inhibit both thrombin and factor Xa, which can help reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism.",,
What is the clinical presentation of thrombophilia?,"The clinical presentation of thrombophilia depends on the location of the clot, but may include extremity swelling, tenderness, warmness, erythema, positive Homan's sign, or cord palpated on calf. The patient may also have signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolus such as shortness of breath, tachycardia, ECG changes, and chest pain.","The clinical presentation of thrombophilia is an increased risk of developing blood clots, which can lead to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and other thromboembolic events. Symptoms may include swelling, pain, and discoloration of the affected area, as well as shortness of breath, chest pain, and dizziness. In some cases, thrombophilia can also cause fatigue, headaches, and cognitive impairment. Additionally, thrombophilia can increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular complications.",,
What is prediabetes and how is it defined?,Prediabetes refers to impaired glucose tolerance and is defined as a fasting plasma glucose ≥100 but ≤125 mg/dL or a 2-hour serum glucose ≥140 but ≤199 mg/dL during oral glucose tolerance test.,"Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes. It is defined as having a fasting plasma glucose level of 100-125 mg/dL or a hemoglobin A1c level of 5.7-6.4%. People with prediabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, and should be monitored closely by their healthcare provider to ensure that their blood sugar levels remain within the normal range.",,
What are some common side effects of Bupropion?,"Headache, insomnia, appetite suppression, rare sexual dysfunction, mild stimulant","Common side effects of Bupropion include dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, headache, constipation, dizziness, agitation, and fatigue.",,
Why does vitamin B12 deficiency cause glossitis?,"Vitamin B12 plays a major role in the formation of DNA. Many epithelial cells show evidence of atrophy, including the tongue – hence the glossitis. Small bowel and stomach are also affected","Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause glossitis, which is an inflammation of the tongue, due to a decrease in the production of red blood cells. This decrease in red blood cells can lead to a decrease in oxygen supply to the tongue, resulting in inflammation and other symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, abdominal swelling, shortness of breath, and weight loss. These symptoms can be further exacerbated by jaundice, bilateral temporalis muscle wasting, hepatosplenomegaly, and tense ascites, which can be caused by the metastatic spread of a malignant tumor.",,
How does Barrett’s oesophagus develop?,Barrett’s oesophagus is defined as areas of columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia extending upwards in the lower oesophagus replacing the normal squamous epithelium. It is due to chronic gastro- oesophageal reflux,"Barrett's oesophagus is a condition in which the normal tissue lining the lower part of the oesophagus is replaced by tissue similar to that found in the intestine. It is thought to develop as a result of chronic acid reflux, which causes damage to the oesophageal lining. This damage can lead to the growth of abnormal cells, which can eventually become cancerous. It is believed that the down-regulation of E-cadherin and the up-regulation of nuclear β-catenin expression may be important steps in the development of Barrett's oesophagus, as these changes have been observed in HPV-positive tonsillar cancer.",,
What are some of the useful tests that can be done to diagnose a urologic disorder?,"Some of the useful tests that can be done to diagnose a urologic disorder include complete blood count, chemistry panel, circulation time, arterial blood gases, drug screen, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, thyroid profile, MRI of the brain, polysomnography, and psychiatry consult","Some useful tests that can be done to diagnose a urologic disorder include physical examination, imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, and X-ray, urine tests, blood tests, cystoscopy, and biopsy. Additionally, for pregnant women, an adequate prenatal examination should include ultrasound screening by specially trained ultrasonographers in tertiary units (DEGUM II/DEGUM III) and serum alpha-fetoprotein measurements.",,
What is the recommended treatment for acute bronchitis?,Azithromycin: 500 mg stat and 250 mg daily for next 4 days (Z-pak) and may repeat,"Treatment for acute bronchitis typically includes rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and open the airways. Cough suppressants may also be prescribed to reduce coughing. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the patient has a history of hypertension or if the bronchitis is caused by a bacterial infection. In this case, the patient's history of hypertension and the presence of fever and chills may warrant a course of antibiotics.",,
What is the diagnostic approach to dizziness or true vertigo?,"The diagnostic approach to dizziness or true vertigo uses anatomy, beginning with the external ear and working inward toward the middle ear, labyrinth, auditory artery and nerve, and vestibular nuclei in the brainstem.","The diagnostic approach to dizziness or true vertigo includes a detailed history and physical examination, including a neurological examination, to determine the cause. Tests such as vestibular testing, imaging studies, and laboratory tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, a mental health evaluation may be necessary to rule out any psychological causes of the dizziness or vertigo.",,
My patient has been found to have a serum bilirubin of 34 μmol/L (2 mg/dL) on three occasions. The other liver tests are normal. He tells me he has Gilbert’s disease; how can I prove this?,"In Gilbert’s, hepatic glucuronidation of bilirubin is 30% of normal so that there is excess of unconjugated bilirubin. To prove the diagnosis you should measure the total and unconjugated bilirubin in the serum, the unconjugated will be high. A normal reticulocyte count will exclude haemolysis and you have the diagnosis. Genetic studies are not necessary.",Genetic testing for mutations in the UGT1A1 gene can be used to confirm the diagnosis of Gilbert's disease.,,
What is the latest recommended drug treatment for hepatitis C?,Pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. The dosage and length of treatment depends on the genotype.,Sofosbuvir and simeprevir,,
"What is the significance of renal disease with respect to anaemia, if any?","Anaemia is common in chronic kidney disease. The anaemia is often the normochromic, normocytic anaemia of chronic disease. The major cause of anaemia is a relative deficiency of erythropoietin. Other causes include bone marrow toxins, haemolysis, deficiency of haematinic factors Recombinant human erythropoietin is effective treatment in these cases; remember to replenish iron stores to optimize therapy","Renal disease can cause anemia due to a decrease in the production of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells. Anemia can also be caused by a decrease in iron absorption, which can be caused by renal disease. Additionally, renal disease can cause anemia due to a decrease in the production of vitamin B12, as well as vitamin D deficiency, which is common among out-patients in Turkey, regardless of gender and age, especially among obese people and during winter and spring. Vitamin B12 is necessary for red blood cell production.",,
What should a clinician look for when examining a patient who has just had a grand mal seizure?,"The clinician should look for evidence of trauma, lacerations of the tongue, and incontinence. They should also look for postictal somnolence and hemiparesis, rule out causes of symptomatic epilepsy, check for an unusual odor to the breath, unilateral dilated pupil or papilledema, focal neurologic signs, nuchal rigidity, and skin lesions","The clinician should look for signs of airway obstruction, respiratory distress, and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. They should also assess for any injuries that may have occurred during the seizure, as well as any neurological deficits such as confusion, memory loss, or difficulty speaking. Additionally, they should assess for any signs of head trauma, such as bruising, swelling, or lacerations.",,
What is the clear definition of ‘bleeding time’ and ‘clotting time’? And what are the applied differences between them?,"The bleeding time measures platelet plug formation in vivo. Platelet function defects and low platelet numbers (<80 x 109 L) result in an increased bleeding time. Activated whole blood clotting time has been replaced by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), which is also known as the partial thromboplastin time with kaolin (PTTK) as a measure of clotting","Bleeding time is a test used to measure the time it takes for a patient's blood to clot. It is used to diagnose and monitor bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease and esophageal varices. The test involves making a small cut on the patient's arm and measuring the time it takes for the bleeding to stop. Clotting time is a test used to measure the time it takes for a patient's blood to form a clot. It is used to diagnose and monitor clotting disorders such as hemophilia. The test involves taking a sample of the patient's blood and measuring the time it takes for the blood to form a clot. The main difference between bleeding time and clotting time is that bleeding time measures the time it takes for the blood to stop flowing, while clotting time measures the time it takes for the blood to form a clot.",,
What are the key symptoms of Generalised anxiety disorder?,"The key symptoms of Generalised anxiety disorder are excessive or unrealistic worry, inappropriate to the situation, affects daily functioning, associated with stress and depression, fast palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling, fear of losing control, poor concentration, insomnia, urinary frequency, frequent or loose bowel motions, erectile dysfunction, hyperventilation, sweating, sinus tachycardia, hypertension, severe anxiety, fear of death/illness, and postural hand tremor","The key symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) include persistent and excessive worry, difficulty controlling worry, restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbances, and changes in appetite or weight. Additionally, people with GAD may experience panic attacks, feelings of dread, difficulty concentrating, and physical symptoms such as trembling, sweating, and nausea.",,
What are some symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia?,"Some symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia include fatigue, breathlessness on exertion, palpitations, chest pain, pallor, koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails), pale nails, glossitis, and angular stomatitis.","Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia include fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, cold hands and feet, brittle nails, and cravings for non-nutritive substances such as ice or dirt. Additionally, iron deficiency anaemia can cause an increased heart rate, low blood pressure, and difficulty concentrating.",,
What are some common side effects of anticholinergics and tricyclic antidepressants?,"Dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation","Common side effects of anticholinergics and tricyclic antidepressants include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, increased heart rate, and potential changes in how pain is perceived that may lead to adaptation of motor function.",,
What are the key symptoms of Deep vein thrombosis?,"The key symptoms of Deep vein thrombosis include diffuse pain in calf, swelling of calf and ankle, unilateral, low-grade fever <39°C, tachycardia, diffuse erythema, lower leg swelling, tender calf muscle, and positive Homan’s sign: Increased pain on dorsiflexion of foot.","The key symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) include swelling, pain, tenderness, and redness in the affected area, as well as warmth in the area of the clot. Other symptoms may include a feeling of heaviness or tightness in the affected area, discoloration of the skin, and a rapid heart rate. In some cases, DVT can also cause difficulty walking or standing, fatigue, and shortness of breath. It is important to seek medical attention if any of these symptoms are present, as DVT can lead to serious complications if left untreated.",,
Can you tell me whether administering low doses of dopamine to increase renal blood flow is today considered obsolete?,"The effect of low-dose dopamine on renal blood flow has been questioned. The effect of increasing urine output is now thought to be largely due to the rise in cardiac output. Low-dose dopamine is still used and is not obsolete, as it often helps in shock whatever the mechanism.","The use of low doses of dopamine to increase renal blood flow is still considered a viable option in some cases, although it is not as widely used as it once was. It is generally accepted that other treatments, such as diuretics, are more effective and have fewer side effects. However, there are still some cases in which low doses of dopamine may be beneficial, such as in patients with renal failure or sepsis, or in cases where other treatments are not effective. Additionally, research has suggested that the sympathetic nervous system may play a role in the reduced capacity for the reactivation of glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis synovial cells, which could be a potential indication for the use of low doses of dopamine.",,
How accurate is ultrasonography in detecting renal calculi?,Small calculi might be missed,"Ultrasonography is a reliable and accurate imaging modality for the detection of renal calculi, with a sensitivity of up to 95%. It is also useful for detecting hydronephrosis, which can be an indication of renal calculi. Ultrasonography is a safe and cost-effective imaging modality for the detection of renal calculi, and is often the first imaging modality used to diagnose the condition.",,
"When examining a patient’s carotid pulse, why should we not palpate both carotids at once? Is it because it might block the blood supply to the brain?","Yes, palpating each carotid separately is safer (one side may have a stenosis/atheroma) and might provide more information, e.g. right carotid sinus massage decreases the sinus node discharge. In addition, carotid sinus syncope can occur, which can impair cerebral perfusion in some elderly patients, causing loss of consciousness.","No, it is not because it might block the blood supply to the brain. Palpating both carotids at once can be misleading because it can cause a false sense of the pulse rate and rhythm, which can lead to inaccurate assessments of the patient's risk of recurrent AMIs through the increased use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and lipid-lowering medications. It is important to palpate each carotid artery separately to get an accurate assessment of the pulse rate and rhythm.",,
"In the treatment of ventricular tachycardia, could lidocaine be used in the absence of any other drug? How effective is lidocaine?","Yes, lidocaine given as a bolus followed by intravenous infusion (2–4 mg/min) is very effective. DC cardioversion is the other option.","Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic drug that can be used to treat ventricular tachycardia. It is most effective when used in combination with other antiarrhythmic drugs, such as amiodarone or procainamide. However, lidocaine can be used as a monotherapy in the absence of other drugs, and has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of ventricular tachycardia episodes. Studies have shown that lidocaine is particularly effective in treating ventricular tachycardia when administered in a timely manner, and can be used to prevent further episodes of ventricular tachycardia.",,
"In patients with myocardial infarction, why is aspirin to be taken chewed, and not by any other method?","Aspirin chewed goes directly into the systemic circulation; if you swallow it, it has to be absorbed in the gut and then be transported by the portal system.","Aspirin should be taken chewed in patients with myocardial infarction because it is more effective when it is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. Chewing the aspirin helps to speed up the absorption process, allowing the patient to benefit from the drug's effects more quickly.",,
"In asthma patients, which is the safest analgesic to use?",Paracetamol,Acetaminophen,,
What are the complications of insulin other than hypoglycaemia and injection?,There are very few complications. Antibodies can be demonstrated in the serum but rarely cause a problem. Patients can react to the protamine added to make long-acting insulins. Weight gain can be a problem and needs to be monitored. Many patients feel hungry on insulin and a reduction in dose may be required.,"Weight gain, lipodystrophy, allergic reactions, hypokalemia, and increased risk of infection.",,
"In sinusitis, it is not the nasal cavity that is congested by excessive mucus but the openings between the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Why, therefore, does sinusitis cause difficulty breathing?","There are two reasons: first, the sinusitis is usually secondary to an upper respiratory tract infection (often viral); second, there is nasal obstruction. Both of these will cause difficulty with breathing.","Sinusitis causes difficulty breathing because the excessive mucus in the paranasal sinuses can block the openings between the sinuses and the nasal cavity, leading to a buildup of pressure in the sinuses. This pressure can cause pain and discomfort, as well as difficulty breathing. Additionally, the mucus can block the Eustachian tubes, which can lead to a feeling of fullness in the ears and difficulty hearing. Abnormalities of the frontonasal duct have been found to be strongly correlated with frontal sinusitis, suggesting that they may be a cause of the condition. Furthermore, early oronasopharyngeal DeLee suctioning at the perineum does not appear to affect the rate of meconium aspiration syndrome, indicating that it is likely an intrauterine event. Biofeedback-relaxation training may be useful for managing the stresses of tinnitus, highlighting the role of psychological factors in tinnitus management. Finally, the method of reporting trial results can alter perceptions of therapeutic effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of measured enthusiasm when discussing the results of clinical trials.",,
Should every patient with trigeminal neuralgia be given an MRI of the brain?,"Yes, trigeminal neuralgia can occur in, for example multiple sclerosis and tumours of the 5th nerve.","No, not every patient with trigeminal neuralgia should be given an MRI of the brain. An MRI may be recommended for patients with trigeminal neuralgia if there are signs or symptoms that suggest a structural cause, such as a tumor or vascular malformation, or if the patient has not responded to conservative treatments such as medications or nerve blocks. Additionally, an MRI may be recommended if the patient has diabetes, as diabetic retinopathy has been linked to neuronal dysfunction, which can be detected through an MRI.",,
Why do some patients with rheumatic fever later progress to chronic rheumatic heart disease?,"Antibodies to streptococcal polysaccharides are substantially elevated and can cross-react with some myocardial tissue antigens. The pathogenesis is, however, far from clear","Rheumatic fever is an autoimmune disorder caused by an immune response to a streptococcal infection. It is thought that the autoimmune response is triggered by cross-reactivity between the streptococcal antigens and the host's own antigens, leading to an inflammatory response that damages the heart valves. This damage can lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease, which is characterized by permanent damage to the heart valves and can lead to long-term complications such as heart failure, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.",,
Is it safe to use the drugs omeprazole and ranitidine during pregnancy?,"Neither drug is recommended in pregnancy, but ranitidine is probably safe. No drug should be used in pregnancy unless absolutely essential.","The safety of omeprazole and ranitidine during pregnancy has not been established. Further research is needed to determine the safety of these drugs during pregnancy, as well as any potential risks associated with their use during this time.",,
What causes a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)?,A raised ESR is due to a rise in the large plasma proteins (e.g. fibrinogen or immunoglobulins). These proteins cause rouleaux formation when the cells clump together like a stack of coins and therefore fall more rapidly in a tube.,"Inflammation, such as that caused by a myocardial infarction.",,
