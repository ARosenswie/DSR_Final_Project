# DSR_Final_Project

Provided within this repositiory is the analysis of data from Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) with given medicines and their corresponding pheontypes.

We need the following bullet points that have the highest priorty:
- [ ] As a PGx app, I want a web service that returns the appropriate "recommendations", "implications" and "warning level" based on "drugid" and "lookupkey".
- [ ] As a PGx expert, based on the CPIC "implications," "recommendations," and "comments," I would like to see a classification of a warning level of green, yellow, or red, where green means no change, yellow means a dose change, and red means a possible drug change. If there are different possibilities, the warning level reflects the "worst case".
- [ ] As a PGx expert, based on the CPIC "implications" and "recommendations", IÂ´d like to receive those in patient-friendly language, with possibly the "comments" column containing information that is important to one of the two, too.
- [ ] As a PGx expert, I want the infos to always be up to date and on top of the latest guidelines.
- [x] As a PGx expert, I would like the "recommendations" to always end with "Consult your pharmacist or doctor to discuss other medication options." or similar.
